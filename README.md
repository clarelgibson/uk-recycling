# UK Recycling
Do councils who employ a kerbside sort system achieve higher recycling rates than those who employ the co-mingled system?

## Description
This project will explore the answer to the question above. Kerbside sort recycling systems place a high burden on the householder to sort and store their waste in up to seven bins, but does this system achieve higher recycling rates than the alternative, co-mingled system, where all recyclable waste is put into a single bin and sorted off-site?
