# Introduction
My parents live in St Helens, north-west England, and have to sort their dry recycling into four different containers (multi-stream). I live in Waverley, in the south-east and our recycling can all go into one bin (co-mingled). Sorting out the recycling and storing all of the different bins can be a burden, and mum and I wondered if it was worth all the effort?

In this paper, I set out to answer the question: "Do local authorities with a multi-stream system of recycling achieve higher rates of recycling than those with a co-mingled system?"

# Methodology
We collected data from all 309 local authorities in England. For recycling rates, we used waste data sourced from [Defra](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1144270/LA_and_Regional_Spreadsheet_202122.xlsx) covering the financial year 2021/22. Recycling rates were calculated based on the total weight of household waste sent for recycling, composting or re-use divided by the total weight of household waste collected. Commercial and industrial waste was not included in this analysis.

For recycling systems, we obtained data through a [Freedom of Information](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/defra-freedom-of-information-environmental-information-releases-starting-january-2021#fois-2023) request to Defra for details of the type of household recycling system used by each local authority in England during the financial year 2021/22.

# Data Overview
Our dataset consists of recycling data from 309 local authorities in England for the financial year 2021/22, which was the latest available data at the time of this analysis. Table 1 shows the number of local authorities and summary statistics for each type of recycling collection system.

```{r table-1}
stats <- 
  data %>% 
  group_by(collection_type, collection_type_sort) %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    collected_waste_per_person = round((sum(household_collected) / sum(population)) * 1000,1),
    median_recycle_rate = scales::percent(median(household_recycle_rate), 0.1),
    mean_recycle_rate = scales::percent(mean(household_recycle_rate), 0.1),
    var_recycle_rate = var(household_recycle_rate),
    sd_recycle_rate = sd(household_recycle_rate)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(collection_type_sort) %>% 
  select(-collection_type_sort) %>% 
  rename(
    `Collection Type` = collection_type,
    `Number of Local Authorities` = n,
    `Total Waste Collected per Person (kg)` = collected_waste_per_person,
    `Median Recycling Rate` = median_recycle_rate,
    `Mean Recycling Rate` = mean_recycle_rate,
    `Variance Recycling Rate` = var_recycle_rate,
    `Standard Deviation Recycling Rate` = sd_recycle_rate
  )

stats %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Table 1: Summary statistics by type of collection system",
    align = "c"
  )

# store vectors of recycling rates for each system
comingled <- data %>% 
  filter(collection_type == "Co-Mingled") %>% 
  select(household_recycle_rate) %>% 
  pull()

twostream <- data %>% 
  filter(collection_type == "Two Stream") %>% 
  select(household_recycle_rate) %>% 
  pull()

multi <- data %>% 
  filter(collection_type == "Multi-Stream") %>% 
  select(household_recycle_rate) %>% 
  pull()
```

# Key Findings
Local authorities employing multi-stream systems achieved an average recycling rate of `r scales::percent(mean(multi, na.rm = TRUE),0.1)`, ahead of two stream systems (`r scales::percent(mean(twostream, na.rm = TRUE),0.1)`) and co-mingled systems (`r scales::percent(mean(comingled, na.rm = TRUE),0.1)`).

```

```{r t-test}
t.test(multi, comingled)
```


# Visualisations
- Use charts, graphs, or tables to visually represent your findings. For example:
  - Bar charts comparing overall recycling rates.
  - Pie charts showing the composition of recycled materials in each system.
  - Line charts illustrating trends over time if applicable.

- Pie Chart: A pie chart illustrating the composition of recycled materials in each system.

# Statistical Analysis

- If you conducted statistical tests, briefly explain the methods used.
- Present the results of any significance tests or confidence intervals.
- Interpret the statistical findings in the context of your research question.

"We conducted a t-test, which revealed a p-value of 0.02, indicating a statistically significant difference in recycling rates between the two systems."

# Discussion

- Interpret the findings and discuss their implications.
- Consider possible reasons for any observed differences in recycling rates.
- Compare your results with existing literature or similar studies if available.

"The higher recycling rates in kerbside sort systems could be attributed to better sorting at the source, leading to cleaner recyclables. Additionally, community awareness and engagement may play a role."

# Limitations

- Acknowledge any limitations in your study, such as data constraints, assumptions, or potential biases.

"It's important to note that our study relies on available data, and variations in local policies or population density might influence the results."

# Recommendations

- If applicable, provide recommendations based on your findings.
- Consider suggesting areas for further research.

"Based on our findings, we recommend local authorities consider the implementation of kerbside sort systems to improve recycling rates. However, further research is needed to explore the long-term sustainability and cost-effectiveness of such systems."

# Conclusion

- Summarize the key points of your presentation.
- Restate your answer to the research question.

"In conclusion, our analysis suggests that local authorities with kerbside sort systems tend to achieve higher recycling rates than those with co-mingled systems."
